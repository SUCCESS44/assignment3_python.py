#Question of the day Jan 11
#Create a function func() which takes a variable number of arguments and prints out those variables.
#So for example if func(23, 25, 25)
#it should print 23, 25, and 25,
#if func(20, 21)
#it should print 20, 21
numbers = (23,25,25)

 #Write a program to create function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate addition and subtraction.
#Also, it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call.

#Write a shut_down functioon that takes one argument. if the argument is yes, the function should return shutting down, if no it should return shut down aborted. if the argument is neither yes or no, the function should return sorry

#Define a function called rental_car_cost with an argument called days. Calculate the cost of renting the car: Every day you rent the car costs $40.(cost=40*days) if you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total(cost-=50).

    #First, def a function called distance_from_zero, with one argument (choose any argument name you like). If the type of the argument is either int or float, the function should return the absolute value of the function input. Otherwise, the function should return "Nope".
